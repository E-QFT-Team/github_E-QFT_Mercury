E-QFT Mercury Simulation Package
================================

This package contains the simulation code for Mercury's perihelion precession
using the Emergent Quantum Field Theory (E-QFT) framework integrated with
the Standard Model of particle physics.

Key modules:
- mercury_eqft_simulation: Core simulation of Mercury's orbit with E-QFT corrections
- generate_figures: Visualization utilities for comparing gravitational models
